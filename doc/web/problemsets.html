<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The problem sets can be downloaded from the Files tab, or found in the doc/pub directory in the course repository.</li>
    <li>This problem set is performed individually. See examination rules on the course web page.
    </li>
    <li>Students are encouraged to discuss together and help each other when solving the problems. However, every student must understand and be able to explain his/her submitted solution. Plagiarism and the use of computer-generated solutions are not allowed.</p>
    </li>
    <li>The two notebooks for each problem set contain a number of basic and extra problems; you can choose which and how many to work on. 
    </li>
    <li>Several problems contain tasks that must be graded using the corresponding Yata Question. These problems will be clearly marked and you must have passed the automatic grading in Yata to receive credits. 
    </li>
    <li>Other problems will be manually graded. Note that manual grading is performed in the teacher's python environment, which is based on the conda `environment.yml` file in the course github repo. Please avoid using additional python modules (such as `plotly`) as this might cause errors.
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Important</strong>: Hand-in is performed through the following actions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Copy and paste your solution code for automatically graded tasks into the corresponding Yata Question. Make sure that you pass the tests and that you obtain a green checkmark.
            </li>
            <li>Upload your solution in the form of your edited version of the jupyter notebook via the appropriate module in Canvas.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

<p>Before you turn this problem in, make sure everything runs as expected. First, restart the kernel (in the menubar, select Kernel Restart) and then run all cells (in the menubar, select Cell Run All).</p>
<p>Make sure that the run time is smaller than a few minutes. If needed you might have to reduce some computational tasks; e.g. by decreasing the number of grid points or sampling steps. Please ask the supervisors if you are uncertain about the run time.</p>
