<ul>
    <li>We aim to publish the problem sets at least two weeks before the deadline and they will then be accessible for download from the Files tab, or found in the doc/pub directory in the course repository.</li>
    <li>Problem sets are performed individually. See examination rules on the course web page.</li>
    <li>Every student must understand their submitted solution in the sense that they should be able to explain and discuss them in detail with a peer or with a teacher.
        <ul>
            <li>Conditional on the above requirement, students are still allowed to discuss together and to help each other when solving the problems and working on projects.</li>
            <li>Conditional on the above requirement, students are&nbsp;also allowed to use generative AI tools for coding assistance. The recommended approach is to first write your own code and only use AI tools for debugging or code improvement. You must fully understand the code that is generated and you are encouraged to perform code tests.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The two notebooks for each problem set contain a number of basic and extra problems; you can choose which and how many to work on.</li>
    <li>Before you submit your solution, make sure everything runs as expected. First, restart the kernel (in the menubar, select Kernel Restart) and then run all cells (in the menubar, select Cell Run All).</li>
	<li>Make sure that the run time is smaller than a few minutes. If needed you might have to reduce some computational tasks; e.g. by decreasing the number of grid points or sampling steps. Please ask the supervisors if you are uncertain about the run time.</li>

        <p><strong>Important remarks on grading</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>It is the submission of solution code and results (in the form of a Jupyter notebook) via the Canvas assignment that is considered as your final hand-in solution. See specific deadlines on the corresponding Canvas Assignments. Note that there are separate Canvas Assignments for basic and extra problems.</li>
    		<li>Several problems contain tasks that must be pre-graded via the corresponding Yata Question before submission. Such problems are clearly marked and you must have passed the automatic grading in Yata (obtaining a green check mark) before handing in your solution to receive credits. Pre-grading via Yata is mandatory AND you must submit your final solution via Canvas. See specific deadlines on the corresponding Yata Questions assignment.</li>
    		<li>Other problems will only be graded manually. Manual grading is performed in the teacher's python environment, which is based on the conda `environment.yml` file in the course github repo. Therefore you cannot use additional python modules as this will cause import errors.</li>
            <li>Face-to-face discussions will be held with a randomly selected subset of students on the first Monday after the problem set deadline. Selected students will meet with one of the teachers and are expected to answer questions on their code implementation and results. No extra preparation is needed for these discussions apart from familiarity with your own solution. A list of randomly selected students will be published on the course web page around Monday noon. During the afternoon session that same day, students will be called in the numbered order until the end of the list (or the end of the exercise session). Note that you must inform the responsible teacher as soon as possible following the publication of the student list if you cannot be physically present at the exercise session (in which case we will have the discussion on zoom).</li>
            <li>An oral examination (on all aspects of the course) will be arranged with the examiner at the end of the course for students that: (i) do not show up for their discussion slot, or (ii) fail to demonstrate convincing familiarity with their hand-in solutions. A small number of students might also be selected randomly for an oral exam including those that opt for late submissions. The oral exm will not provide extra credits but only serves to certify the points reached via the submissions.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
    	<p><strong>Late submissions</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
    		<li>Problem sets that are handed in post deadline will be graded at a reduced rate of 2/3 (2 points awarded for every 3 points passed).</li> 
    		<li>Late submissions will only be eligible for points corresponding to the minimum required for a passing grade (for Chalmers PhD students this corresponds to grade 4).</li>
    		<li>Late hand-ins will be graded in December/January (handed in before Nov. 30th) or August/September (handed in before July 31st).</li>
    	</ul>
