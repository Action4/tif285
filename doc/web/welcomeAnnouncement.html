    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
    <p>Welcome to the course "<a title="Course syllabus" href="https://chalmers.instructure.com/courses/35734/pages/course-syllabus" data-course-type="wikiPages" data-published="true" data-api-endpoint="https://chalmers.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/35734/pages/course-syllabus" data-api-returntype="Page">Learning from data</a>". &nbsp;We start on Monday Sep. 1 at 13.15 in the <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://maps.chalmers.se/#a698b8e2-5f2d-44a1-9651-1b90abe7f113" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HA3 lecture hall</a>, with the first lecture and introduction to the course.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The course aims to teach an advanced physicist's approach to Learning from data. It is project based, using python and Jupyter Notebooks as a computational environment. There is no written exam but there will be face-to-face discussions with the teachers on your problem set solutions.</p>
    <p><span>Getting ready for the course you are welcome to follow the </span><a title="Getting started" href="https://chalmers.instructure.com/courses/35734/pages/getting-started" data-course-type="wikiPages" data-published="true" data-api-endpoint="https://chalmers.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/35734/pages/getting-started" data-api-returntype="Page">getting started guide</a> on the course web page. There is a dedicated getting-started session on the first Monday afternoon where the teachers will demonstrate the download of course material and setup of the python environment. After this demonstration you will have a chance to ask questions and get help with your own installation. Note that this is the preferred opportunity for assistance in getting started. The other lab sessions will be focused on exercises, problem sets and projects.</p>
    <p>The course is accompanied by a comprehensive set of lecture notes that also includes demonstration and exercise notebooks. These notes are published open-access (<a class="inline_disabled external" href="https://cforssen.gitlab.io/tif285-book/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://cforssen.gitlab.io/tif285-book/</a>) in the Jupyter Book format. You are in particular encouraged to get prepared by studying the first three exercise sections that provide guides for the use of Python, Jupyter Notebooks and NumPy (sections 2, 3, and 4 in the Introduction chapter). You are also encouraged to review section 6 that contains a summary of important concepts in mathematical statistics.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The exercise notebooks can be downloaded&nbsp; in the ipynb format from the Jupyter Book and can then be run in your newly installed python environment. In case you did not yet manage to complete the getting started installation instructions, you could still be able to run the exercise notebooks online by uploading them at<span>&nbsp;</span><a class="inline_disabled external" href="https://colab.research.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://colab.research.google.com/</a>. Note, however, that several of the Jupyter Notebook features will not work in the google colab environment.</p>
    <p>All lectures and the computer lab sessions will be on campus. Note in particular that the Thursday morning session typically starts with a demonstration or feedback discussion led by one of the teaching assistants.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Throughout the course, we will be using the Yata Discussions forum to facilitate recurrent group discussions between students and with teachers. See the<span>&nbsp;</span><a title="Online teaching and extra resources" href="https://chalmers.instructure.com/courses/35734/pages/online-teaching-and-extra-resources" data-course-type="wikiPages" data-published="true" data-api-endpoint="https://chalmers.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/35734/pages/online-teaching-and-extra-resources" data-api-returntype="Page">Online teaching and extra resources</a>.</p>
    <p>Looking forward to meeting you soon.<br />/Christian<br />and Anna, Esm&eacute;e, Oliver, Taylor</p>
