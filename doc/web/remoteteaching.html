learning platform to facilitate group discussions between students and with teachers. Feel free to post questions here, and to contribute with answers and suggestions. The platform is inspired by the <a href="https://stackexchange.com/">Stack Exchange</a> forums that are widely used in, e.g., coding communities. You can up- or down-vote posts and you can mark accepted answers. Our aim is to encourage collective efforts and increase individual learning. The interface allows various advanced formatting: (i) latex for math expressions, (ii) code blocks, (iii) links, and you can upload images. Posts can be made anonymously (except for teachers whose names are always displayed).</p>
