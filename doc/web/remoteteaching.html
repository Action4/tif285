   <h3>Livestreaming on zoom</h3>
   <p>Lab sessions will be livestreamed on Zoom.</p>
   
   <p>To prepare for this, please get familiar with how to login to Zoom: <a href="https://chalmers.zoom.us/">https://chalmers.zoom.us/</a> (Links to an external site.). The link to the livestream meeting room is published at the top of this page. The meeting is protected by a password that will be sent separately via a Canvas announcement. In addition, only authenticated users are allowed to join the meeting.</p>

<p>To login, you will need a working CID or GU account. Test if you can login and, if not, obtain a working account.</p>

<h3><span>Lab sessions</span></h3>
<p>The computer lab sessions will be livestreamed via zoom with the possibility for remote supervision. The Thursday morning sessions will typically start with a demonstration or feedback discussion led by one of the teaching assistants (see the
    <script>
	document.write('<a href="' + schedule + '">Weekly schedule</a>');
	</script>
	<noscript>
		Weekly schedule
	</noscript>
).</p>

<p>
During the lab sessions you are expected to work on exercises, problem sets and projects and you will have the opportunity to discuss with the supervisors and with your fellow students. Concerning which computer to use, you have three options:
<ul>
<li>Use one of the computers in rooms F-T7203, F-T7204, FT4011. These rooms are reserved for us on Thursdays from 8-12. They can also be used other times if available. </li>
<li>Log in remotely to one of the Chalmers STUdat linux computers. See instructions at <a href="https://chalmers.topdesk.net/tas/public/ssp/content/detail/knowledgeitem?unid=304967f9ad004d3293b986a976e39833">https://chalmers.topdesk.net/</a>. Depending on your platform, find the relevant set of instructions for "How do I remotely access a StuDAT Linux computer from my [select platform]". You might want to use the /bin/bash shell rather than the default /bin/sh.</li>
<li>Use your personal computer.</li>
</ul>
In all cases you need to have your own headset (microphone and headphones) for remote interactions, and you first need to follow the 
    <script>
	document.write('<a href="' + gettingstarted + '">Getting started</a>');
	</script>
	<noscript>
		Getting started
	</noscript>
	instructions.
</p>

<p>We will be using zoom breakout rooms for remote group work and supervision. Please follow the instructions from the teaching assistants after joining the lab sessions.

<h3><span>Yata discussions</span></h3>
<p>We will be using the

learning platform to facilitate group discussions between students and with teachers. Feel free to post questions here, and to contribute with answers and suggestions. The platform is inspired by the <a href="https://stackexchange.com/">Stack Exchange</a> forums that are widely used in, e.g., coding communities. You can up- or down-vote posts and you can mark accepted answers. Our aim is to encourage collective efforts and increase individual learning. The interface allows various advanced formatting: (i) latex for math expressions, (ii) code blocks, (iii) links, and you can upload images. Posts can be made anonymously (except for teachers whose names are always displayed).</p>
