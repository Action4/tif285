=====  Statistical analysis ===== 
!bblock 

* As in other experiments, many numerical  experiments have two classes of errors:
  * Statistical errors
  * Systematical errors
* Statistical errors can be estimated using standard tools from statistics
* Systematical errors are method specific and must be treated differently from case to case.

===== Statistics  ===== 
!bblock
The *probability distribution function (PDF)* is a function
$p(x)$ on the domain which, in the discrete case, gives us the
probability or relative frequency with which these values of $X$ occur:
!bt
\[
p(x) = \mathrm{prob}(X=x)
\]
!et
In the continuous case, the PDF does not directly depict the
actual probability. Instead we define the probability for the
stochastic variable to assume any value on an infinitesimal interval
around $x$ to be $p(x)dx$. The continuous function $p(x)$ then gives us
the *density* of the probability rather than the probability
itself. The probability for a stochastic variable to assume any value
on a non-infinitesimal interval $[a,\,b]$ is then just the integral:
!bt
\[
\mathrm{prob}(a\leq X\leq b) = \int_a^b p(x)dx
\]
!et
Qualitatively speaking, a stochastic variable represents the values of
numbers chosen as if by chance from some specified PDF so that the
selection of a large set of these numbers reproduces this PDF.
!eblock


!split
===== Statistics, moments =====
!bblock
A particularly useful class of special expectation values are the
*moments*. The $n$-th moment of the PDF $p$ is defined as
follows:
!bt
\[
\langle x^n\rangle \equiv \int\! x^n p(x)\,dx
\]
!et
The zero-th moment $\langle 1\rangle$ is just the normalization condition of
$p$. The first moment, $\langle x\rangle$, is called the *mean* of $p$
and often denoted by the letter $\mu$:
!bt
\[
\langle x\rangle = \mu \equiv \int\! x p(x)\,dx
\]
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Statistics, central moments =====
!bblock
A special version of the moments is the set of *central moments*,
the n-th central moment defined as:
!bt
\[
\langle (x-\langle x \rangle )^n\rangle \equiv \int\! (x-\langle x\rangle)^n p(x)\,dx
\]
!et
The zero-th and first central moments are both trivial, equal $1$ and
$0$, respectively. But the second central moment, known as the
*variance* of $p$, is of particular interest. For the stochastic
variable $X$, the variance is denoted as $\sigma^2_X$ or $\mathrm{var}(X)$:
!bt
\begin{align}
\sigma^2_X\ \ =\ \ \mathrm{var}(X) & =  \langle (x-\langle x\rangle)^2\rangle =
\int\! (x-\langle x\rangle)^2 p(x)\,dx\\
& =  \int\! \left(x^2 - 2 x \langle x\rangle^{2} +
  \langle x\rangle^2\right)p(x)\,dx\\
& =  \langle x^2\rangle - 2 \langle x\rangle\langle x\rangle + \langle x\rangle^2\\
& =  \langle x^2\rangle - \langle x\rangle^2
\end{align}
!et
The square root of the variance, $\sigma =\sqrt{\langle (x-\langle x\rangle)^2\rangle}$ is called the *standard deviation* of $p$. It is clearly just the RMS (root-mean-square)
value of the deviation of the PDF from its mean value, interpreted
qualitatively as the *spread* of $p$ around its mean.
!eblock

!split
===== Statistics, covariance =====
!bblock
Another important quantity is the so called covariance, a variant of
the above defined variance. Consider again the set $\{X_i\}$ of $n$
stochastic variables (not necessarily uncorrelated) with the
multivariate PDF $P(x_1,\dots,x_n)$. The *covariance* of two
of the stochastic variables, $X_i$ and $X_j$, is defined as follows:
!bt
\begin{align}
\mathrm{cov}(X_i,\,X_j) &\equiv \langle (x_i-\langle x_i\rangle)(x_j-\langle x_j\rangle)\rangle
\nonumber\\
&=
\int\!\cdots\!\int\!(x_i-\langle x_i \rangle)(x_j-\langle x_j \rangle)\,
P(x_1,\dots,x_n)\,dx_1\dots dx_n
label{eq:def_covariance}
\end{align}
!et
with
!bt
\[
\langle x_i\rangle =
\int\!\cdots\!\int\!x_i\,P(x_1,\dots,x_n)\,dx_1\dots dx_n
\]
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Statistics, more covariance  =====
!bblock
If we consider the above covariance as a matrix $C_{ij}=\mathrm{cov}(X_i,\,X_j)$, then the diagonal elements are just the familiar
variances, $C_{ii} = \mathrm{cov}(X_i,\,X_i) = \mathrm{var}(X_i)$. It turns out that
all the off-diagonal elements are zero if the stochastic variables are
uncorrelated. This is easy to show, keeping in mind the linearity of
the expectation value. Consider the stochastic variables $X_i$ and
$X_j$, ($i\neq j$):
!bt
\begin{align}
\mathrm{cov}(X_i,\,X_j) &= \langle(x_i-\langle x_i\rangle)(x_j-\langle x_j\rangle)\rangle\\
&=\langle x_i x_j - x_i\langle x_j\rangle - \langle x_i\rangle x_j + \langle x_i\rangle\langle x_j\rangle\rangle \\
&=\langle x_i x_j\rangle - \langle x_i\langle x_j\rangle\rangle - \langle \langle x_i\rangle x_j\rangle +
\langle \langle x_i\rangle\langle x_j\rangle\rangle\\
&=\langle x_i x_j\rangle - \langle x_i\rangle\langle x_j\rangle - \langle x_i\rangle\langle x_j\rangle +
\langle x_i\rangle\langle x_j\rangle\\
&=\langle x_i x_j\rangle - \langle x_i\rangle\langle x_j\rangle
\end{align}
!et
!eblock



!split
===== Statistics, independent variables  =====
!bblock
If $X_i$ and $X_j$ are independent, we get 
$\langle x_i x_j\rangle =\langle x_i\rangle\langle x_j\rangle$, resulting in $\mathrm{cov}(X_i, X_j) = 0\ \ (i\neq j)$.

Also useful for us is the covariance of linear combinations of
stochastic variables. Let $\{X_i\}$ and $\{Y_i\}$ be two sets of
stochastic variables. Let also $\{a_i\}$ and $\{b_i\}$ be two sets of
scalars. Consider the linear combination:
!bt
\[
U = \sum_i a_i X_i \qquad V = \sum_j b_j Y_j
\]
!et
By the linearity of the expectation value
!bt
\[
\mathrm{cov}(U, V) = \sum_{i,j}a_i b_j \mathrm{cov}(X_i, Y_j)
\]
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Statistics, more variance  =====
!bblock
Now, since the variance is just $\mathrm{var}(X_i) = \mathrm{cov}(X_i, X_i)$, we get
the variance of the linear combination $U = \sum_i a_i X_i$:
!bt
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{var}(U) = \sum_{i,j}a_i a_j \mathrm{cov}(X_i, X_j)
label{eq:variance_linear_combination}
\end{equation}
!et
And in the special case when the stochastic variables are
uncorrelated, the off-diagonal elements of the covariance are as we
know zero, resulting in:
!bt
\[
\mathrm{var}(U) = \sum_i a_i^2 \mathrm{cov}(X_i, X_i) = \sum_i a_i^2 \mathrm{var}(X_i)
\]
!et
!bt
\[
\mathrm{var}(\sum_i a_i X_i) = \sum_i a_i^2 \mathrm{var}(X_i)
\]
!et
which will become very useful in our study of the error in the mean
value of a set of measurements.
!eblock

!split
===== Statistics and stochastic processes  =====
!bblock
A *stochastic process* is a process that produces sequentially a
chain of values:
!bt
\[
\{x_1, x_2,\dots\,x_k,\dots\}.
\]
!et
We will call these
values our *measurements* and the entire set as our measured
*sample*.  The action of measuring all the elements of a sample
we will call a stochastic *experiment* since, operationally,
they are often associated with results of empirical observation of
some physical or mathematical phenomena; precisely an experiment. We
assume that these values are distributed according to some 
PDF $p_X^{\phantom X}(x)$, where $X$ is just the formal symbol for the
stochastic variable whose PDF is $p_X^{\phantom X}(x)$. Instead of
trying to determine the full distribution $p$ we are often only
interested in finding the few lowest moments, like the mean
$\mu_X^{\phantom X}$ and the variance $\sigma_X^{\phantom X}$.
!eblock


!split 
===== Statistics and sample variables  =====
!bblock
In practical situations a sample is always of finite size. Let that
size be $n$. The expectation value of a sample, the *sample mean*, is then defined as follows:
!bt
\[
\bar{x}_n \equiv \frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=1}^n x_k
\]
!et
The *sample variance* is:
!bt
\[
\mathrm{var}(x) \equiv \frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=1}^n (x_k - \bar{x}_n)^2
\]
!et
its square root being the *standard deviation of the sample*. The
*sample covariance* is:
!bt
\[
\mathrm{cov}(x)\equiv\frac{1}{n}\sum_{kl}(x_k - \bar{x}_n)(x_l - \bar{x}_n)
\]
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Statistics, sample variance and covariance =====
!bblock
Note that the sample variance is the sample covariance without the
cross terms. In a similar manner as the covariance in Eq.~(ref{eq:def_covariance}) is a measure of the correlation between
two stochastic variables, the above defined sample covariance is a
measure of the sequential correlation between succeeding measurements
of a sample.

These quantities, being known experimental values, differ
significantly from and must not be confused with the similarly named
quantities for stochastic variables, mean $\mu_X$, variance $\mathrm{var}(X)$
and covariance $\mathrm{cov}(X,Y)$.
!eblock

!split
===== Statistics, law of large numbers =====
!bblock
The law of large numbers
states that as the size of our sample grows to infinity, the sample
mean approaches the true mean $\mu_X^{\phantom X}$ of the chosen PDF:
!bt
\[
\lim_{n\to\infty}\bar{x}_n = \mu_X^{\phantom X}
\]
!et
The sample mean $\bar{x}_n$ works therefore as an estimate of the true
mean $\mu_X^{\phantom X}$.

What we need to find out is how good an approximation $\bar{x}_n$ is to
$\mu_X^{\phantom X}$. In any stochastic measurement, an estimated
mean is of no use to us without a measure of its error. A quantity
that tells us how well we can reproduce it in another experiment. We
are therefore interested in the PDF of the sample mean itself. Its
standard deviation will be a measure of the spread of sample means,
and we will simply call it the *error* of the sample mean, or
just sample error, and denote it by $\mathrm{err}_X^{\phantom X}$. In
practice, we will only be able to produce an *estimate* of the
sample error since the exact value would require the knowledge of the
true PDFs behind, which we usually do not have.
!eblock


!split
===== Statistics, more on sample error =====
!bblock
Let us first take a look at what happens to the sample error as the
size of the sample grows. In a sample, each of the measurements $x_i$
can be associated with its own stochastic variable $X_i$. The
stochastic variable $\overline X_n$ for the sample mean $\bar{x}_n$ is
then just a linear combination, already familiar to us:
!bt
\[
\overline X_n = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n X_i
\]
!et
All the coefficients are just equal $1/n$. The PDF of $\overline X_n$,
denoted by $p_{\overline X_n}(x)$ is the desired PDF of the sample
means. 
!eblock

!split
===== Statistics  =====
!bblock
The probability density of obtaining a sample mean $\bar x_n$
is the product of probabilities of obtaining arbitrary values $x_1,
x_2,\dots,x_n$ with the constraint that the mean of the set $\{x_i\}$
is $\bar x_n$:
!bt
\[
p_{\overline X_n}(x) = \int p_X^{\phantom X}(x_1)\cdots
\int p_X^{\phantom X}(x_n)\ 
\delta\!\left(x - \frac{x_1+x_2+\dots+x_n}{n}\right)dx_n \cdots dx_1
\]
!et
And in particular we are interested in its variance $\mathrm{var}(\overline X_n)$.
!eblock



!split
===== Statistics, central limit theorem =====
!bblock
It is generally not possible to express $p_{\overline X_n}(x)$ in a
closed form given an arbitrary PDF $p_X^{\phantom X}$ and a number
$n$. But for the limit $n\to\infty$ it is possible to make an
approximation. The very important result is called *the central limit theorem*. It tells us that as $n$ goes to infinity,
$p_{\overline X_n}(x)$ approaches a Gaussian distribution whose mean
and variance equal the true mean and variance, $\mu_{X}^{\phantom X}$
and $\sigma_{X}^{2}$, respectively:
!bt
\begin{equation}
\lim_{n\to\infty} p_{\overline X_n}(x) =
\left(\frac{n}{2\pi\mathrm{var}(X)}\right)^{1/2}
e^{-\frac{n(x-\bar x_n)^2}{2\mathrm{var}(X)}}
label{eq:central_limit_gaussian}
\end{equation}
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Statistics, more technicalities  =====
!bblock
The desired variance
$\mathrm{var}(\overline X_n)$, i.e. the sample error squared
$\mathrm{err}_X^2$, is given by:
!bt
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{err}_X^2 = \mathrm{var}(\overline X_n) = \frac{1}{n^2}
\sum_{ij} \mathrm{cov}(X_i, X_j)
label{eq:error_exact}
\end{equation}
!et
We see now that in order to calculate the exact error of the sample
with the above expression, we would need the true means
$\mu_{X_i}^{\phantom X}$ of the stochastic variables $X_i$. To
calculate these requires that we know the true multivariate PDF of all
the $X_i$. But this PDF is unknown to us, we have only got the measurements of
one sample. The best we can do is to let the sample itself be an
estimate of the PDF of each of the $X_i$, estimating all properties of
$X_i$ through the measurements of the sample.
!eblock


!split
===== Statistics =====
!bblock
Our estimate of $\mu_{X_i}^{\phantom X}$ is then the sample mean $\bar x$
itself, in accordance with the the central limit theorem:
!bt
\[
\mu_{X_i}^{\phantom X} = \langle x_i\rangle \approx \frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=1}^n x_k = \bar x
\]
!et
Using $\bar x$ in place of $\mu_{X_i}^{\phantom X}$ we can give an
*estimate* of the covariance in Eq.~(ref{eq:error_exact})
!bt
\[
\mathrm{cov}(X_i, X_j) = \langle (x_i-\langle x_i\rangle)(x_j-\langle x_j\rangle)\rangle
\approx\langle (x_i - \bar x)(x_j - \bar{x})\rangle,
\]
!et
resulting in
!bt
\[ 
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{l}^n \left(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k}^n (x_k -\bar x_n)(x_l - \bar x_n)\right)=\frac{1}{n}\frac{1}{n} \sum_{kl} (x_k -\bar x_n)(x_l - \bar x_n)=\frac{1}{n}\mathrm{cov}(x)
\]
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Statistics and sample variance  =====
!bblock
By the same procedure we can use the sample variance as an
estimate of the variance of any of the stochastic variables $X_i$
!bt
\[
\mathrm{var}(X_i)=\langle x_i - \langle x_i\rangle\rangle \approx \langle x_i - \bar x_n\rangle\nonumber,
\]
!et
which is approximated as 
!bt
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{var}(X_i)\approx \frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=1}^n (x_k - \bar x_n)=\mathrm{var}(x)
label{eq:var_estimate_i_think}
\end{equation}
!et

Now we can calculate an estimate of the error
$\mathrm{err}_X^{\phantom X}$ of the sample mean $\bar x_n$:
!bt
\begin{align}
\mathrm{err}_X^2
&=\frac{1}{n^2}\sum_{ij} \mathrm{cov}(X_i, X_j) \nonumber \\
&\approx&\frac{1}{n^2}\sum_{ij}\frac{1}{n}\mathrm{cov}(x) =\frac{1}{n^2}n^2\frac{1}{n}\mathrm{cov}(x)\nonumber\\
&=\frac{1}{n}\mathrm{cov}(x)
label{eq:error_estimate}
\end{align}
!et
which is nothing but the sample covariance divided by the number of
measurements in the sample.
!eblock

!split
===== Statistics, uncorrelated results =====
!bblock

In the special case that the measurements of the sample are
uncorrelated (equivalently the stochastic variables $X_i$ are
uncorrelated) we have that the off-diagonal elements of the covariance
are zero. This gives the following estimate of the sample error:
!bt
\[
\mathrm{err}_X^2=\frac{1}{n^2}\sum_{ij} \mathrm{cov}(X_i, X_j) =
\frac{1}{n^2} \sum_i \mathrm{var}(X_i),
\]
!et
resulting in
!bt
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{err}_X^2\approx \frac{1}{n^2} \sum_i \mathrm{var}(x)= \frac{1}{n}\mathrm{var}(x)
label{eq:error_estimate_uncorrel}
\end{equation}
!et
where in the second step we have used Eq.~(ref{eq:var_estimate_i_think}).
The error of the sample is then just its standard deviation divided by
the square root of the number of measurements the sample contains.
This is a very useful formula which is easy to compute. It acts as a
first approximation to the error, but in numerical experiments, we
cannot overlook the always present correlations.
!eblock

!split
===== Statistics, computations =====
!bblock
For computational purposes one usually splits up the estimate of
$\mathrm{err}_X^2$, given by Eq.~(ref{eq:error_estimate}), into two
parts
!bt
\[
\mathrm{err}_X^2 = \frac{1}{n}\mathrm{var}(x) + \frac{1}{n}(\mathrm{cov}(x)-\mathrm{var}(x)),
\]
!et
which equals
!bt
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{n^2}\sum_{k=1}^n (x_k - \bar x_n)^2 +\frac{2}{n^2}\sum_{k<l} (x_k - \bar x_n)(x_l - \bar x_n)
label{eq:error_estimate_split_up}
\end{equation}
!et
The first term is the same as the error in the uncorrelated case,
Eq.~(ref{eq:error_estimate_uncorrel}). This means that the second
term accounts for the error correction due to correlation between the
measurements. For uncorrelated measurements this second term is zero.
!eblock

!split
===== Statistics, more on computations of errors =====
!bblock
Computationally the uncorrelated first term is much easier to treat
efficiently than the second.
!bt
\[
\mathrm{var}(x) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=1}^n (x_k - \bar x_n)^2 =
\left(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=1}^n x_k^2\right) - \bar x_n^2
\]
!et
We just accumulate separately the values $x^2$ and $x$ for every
measurement $x$ we receive. The correlation term, though, has to be
calculated at the end of the experiment since we need all the
measurements to calculate the cross terms. Therefore, all measurements
have to be stored throughout the experiment.
!eblock




!split
===== Statistics, wrapping up 1 =====
!bblock
Let us analyze the problem by splitting up the correlation term into
partial sums of the form:
!bt
\[
f_d = \frac{1}{n-d}\sum_{k=1}^{n-d}(x_k - \bar x_n)(x_{k+d} - \bar x_n)
\]
!et
The correlation term of the error can now be rewritten in terms of
$f_d$
!bt
\[
\frac{2}{n}\sum_{k<l} (x_k - \bar x_n)(x_l - \bar x_n) =
2\sum_{d=1}^{n-1} f_d
\]
!et
The value of $f_d$ reflects the correlation between measurements
separated by the distance $d$ in the sample samples.  Notice that for
$d=0$, $f$ is just the sample variance, $\mathrm{var}(x)$. If we divide $f_d$
by $\mathrm{var}(x)$, we arrive at the so called *autocorrelation function*
!bt
\[
\kappa_d = \frac{f_d}{\mathrm{var}(x)}
\]
!et
which gives us a useful measure of pairwise correlations
starting always at $1$ for $d=0$.
!eblock


!split
===== Statistics, final expression =====
!bblock
The sample error (see eq.~(ref{eq:error_estimate_split_up})) can now be
written in terms of the autocorrelation function:
!bt
\begin{align}
\mathrm{err}_X^2 &=
\frac{1}{n}\mathrm{var}(x)+\frac{2}{n}\cdot\mathrm{var}(x)\sum_{d=1}^{n-1}
\frac{f_d}{\mathrm{var}(x)}\nonumber\\ &=&
\left(1+2\sum_{d=1}^{n-1}\kappa_d\right)\frac{1}{n}\mathrm{var}(x)\nonumber\\
&=\frac{\tau}{n}\cdot\mathrm{var}(x)
label{eq:error_estimate_corr_time}
\end{align}
!et
and we see that $\mathrm{err}_X$ can be expressed in terms the
uncorrelated sample variance times a correction factor $\tau$ which
accounts for the correlation between measurements. We call this
correction factor the *autocorrelation time*:
!bt
\begin{equation}
\tau = 1+2\sum_{d=1}^{n-1}\kappa_d
label{eq:autocorrelation_time}
\end{equation}
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Statistics, effective number of correlations =====
!bblock
For a correlation free experiment, $\tau$
equals 1. From the point of view of
eq.~(ref{eq:error_estimate_corr_time}) we can interpret a sequential
correlation as an effective reduction of the number of measurements by
a factor $\tau$. The effective number of measurements becomes:
!bt
\[
n_\mathrm{eff} = \frac{n}{\tau}
\]
!et
To neglect the autocorrelation time $\tau$ will always cause our
simple uncorrelated estimate of $\mathrm{err}_X^2\approx \mathrm{var}(x)/n$ to
be less than the true sample error. The estimate of the error will be
too *good*. On the other hand, the calculation of the full
autocorrelation time poses an efficiency problem if the set of
measurements is very large.
!eblock



!split 
===== Linking the regression analysis with a statistical interpretation =====

Finally, we are going to discuss several statistical properties which can be obtained in terms of analytical expressions. 
The
advantage of doing linear regression is that we actually end up with
analytical expressions for several statistical quantities.  
Standard least squares and Ridge regression  allow us to
derive quantities like the variance and other expectation values in a
rather straightforward way.


It is assumed that $\varepsilon_i
\sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$ and the $\varepsilon_{i}$ are
independent, i.e.: 
!bt
\begin{align*} 
\mbox{Cov}(\varepsilon_{i_1},
\varepsilon_{i_2}) & = \left\{ \begin{array}{lcc} \sigma^2 & \mbox{if}
& i_1 = i_2, \\ 0 & \mbox{if} & i_1 \not= i_2.  \end{array} \right.
\end{align*} 
!et
The randomness of $\varepsilon_i$ implies that
$\mathbf{y}_i$ is also a random variable. In particular,
$\mathbf{y}_i$ is normally distributed, because $\varepsilon_i \sim
\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$ and $\mathbf{X}_{i,\ast} \, \bm{\beta}$ is a
non-random scalar. To specify the parameters of the distribution of
$\mathbf{y}_i$ we need to calculate its first two moments. 

Recall that $\bm{X}$ is a matrix of dimensionality $n\times p$. The
notation above $\mathbf{X}_{i,\ast}$ means that we are looking at the
row number $i$ and perform a sum over all values $p$.


!split
===== Assumptions made =====

The assumption we have made here can be summarized as (and this is going to useful when we discuss the bias-variance trade off)
that there exists a function $f(\bm{x})$ and  a normal distributed error $\bm{\varepsilon}\sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$
which describes our data
!bt
\[
\bm{y} = f(\bm{x})+\bm{\varepsilon}
\]
!et

We approximate this function with our model from the solution of the linear regression equations, that is our
function $f$ is approximated by $\bm{\tilde{y}}$ where we want to minimize $(\bm{y}-\bm{\tilde{y}})^2$, our MSE, with
!bt
\[
\bm{\tilde{y}} = \bm{X}\bm{\beta}.
\]
!et

!split
===== Expectation value and variance =====

We can calculate the expectation value of $\bm{y}$ for a given element $i$ 
!bt
\begin{align*} 
\mathbb{E}(y_i) & =
\mathbb{E}(\mathbf{X}_{i, \ast} \, \bm{\beta}) + \mathbb{E}(\varepsilon_i)
\, \, \, = \, \, \, \mathbf{X}_{i, \ast} \, \beta, 
\end{align*} 
!et
while
its variance is 
!bt
\begin{align*} \mbox{Var}(y_i) & = \mathbb{E} \{ [y_i
- \mathbb{E}(y_i)]^2 \} \, \, \, = \, \, \, \mathbb{E} ( y_i^2 ) -
[\mathbb{E}(y_i)]^2  \\  & = \mathbb{E} [ ( \mathbf{X}_{i, \ast} \,
\beta + \varepsilon_i )^2] - ( \mathbf{X}_{i, \ast} \, \bm{\beta})^2 \\ &
= \mathbb{E} [ ( \mathbf{X}_{i, \ast} \, \bm{\beta})^2 + 2 \varepsilon_i
\mathbf{X}_{i, \ast} \, \bm{\beta} + \varepsilon_i^2 ] - ( \mathbf{X}_{i,
\ast} \, \beta)^2 \\  & = ( \mathbf{X}_{i, \ast} \, \bm{\beta})^2 + 2
\mathbb{E}(\varepsilon_i) \mathbf{X}_{i, \ast} \, \bm{\beta} +
\mathbb{E}(\varepsilon_i^2 ) - ( \mathbf{X}_{i, \ast} \, \bm{\beta})^2 
\\ & = \mathbb{E}(\varepsilon_i^2 ) \, \, \, = \, \, \,
\mbox{Var}(\varepsilon_i) \, \, \, = \, \, \, \sigma^2.  
\end{align*}
!et
Hence, $y_i \sim \mathcal{N}( \mathbf{X}_{i, \ast} \, \bm{\beta}, \sigma^2)$, that is $\bm{y}$ follows a normal distribution with 
mean value $\bm{X}\bm{\beta}$ and variance $\sigma^2$ (not be confused with the singular values of the SVD). 

!split
===== Expectation value and variance for $\bm{\beta}$ =====

With the OLS expressions for the parameters $\bm{\beta}$ we can evaluate the expectation value
!bt
\[
\mathbb{E}(\bm{\beta}) = \mathbb{E}[ (\mathbf{X}^{\top} \mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{Y}]=(\mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbb{E}[ \mathbf{Y}]=(\mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{X})^{-1} \mathbf{X}^{T}\mathbf{X}\bm{\beta}=\bm{\beta}.
\]
!et
This means that the estimator of the regression parameters is unbiased.

We can also calculate the variance

The variance of $\bm{\beta}$ is

where we have used  that $\mathbb{E} (\mathbf{Y} \mathbf{Y}^{T}) =
\mathbf{X} \, \bm{\beta} \, \bm{\beta}^{T} \, \mathbf{X}^{T} +
\sigma^2 \, \mathbf{I}_{nn}$. From $\mbox{Var}(\bm{\beta}) = \sigma^2
\, (\mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{X})^{-1}$, one obtains an estimate of the
variance of the estimate of the $j$-th regression coefficient:
$\hat{\sigma}^2 (\hat{\beta}_j ) = \hat{\sigma}^2 \sqrt{
[(\mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{X})^{-1}]_{jj} }$. This may be used to
construct a confidence interval for the estimates.


In a similar way, we cna obtain analytical expressions for say the
expectation values of the parameters $\bm{\beta}$ and their variance
when we employ Ridge regression, and thereby a confidence interval. 

It is rather straightforward to show that
!bt
\[
\mathbb{E} \big[ \bm{\beta}^{\mathrm{Ridge}} \big]=(\mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{X} + \lambda \mathbf{I}_{pp})^{-1} (\mathbf{X}^{\top} \mathbf{X})\bm{\beta}^{\mathrm{OLS}}.
\]
!et
We see clearly that 
$\mathbb{E} \big[ \bm{\beta}^{\mathrm{Ridge}} \big] \not= \bm{\beta}^{\mathrm{OLS}}$ for any $\lambda > 0$. We say then that the ridge estimator is biased.

We can also compute the variance as 

!bt
\[
\mbox{Var}[\bm{\beta}^{\mathrm{Ridge}}]=\sigma^2[  \mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{X} + \lambda \mathbf{I} ]^{-1}  \mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{X} \{ [  \mathbf{X}^{\top} \mathbf{X} + \lambda \mathbf{I} ]^{-1}\}^{T},
\]
!et
and it is easy to see that if the parameter $\lambda$ goes to infinity then the variance of Ridge parameters $\bm{\beta}$ goes to zero. 

With this, we can compute the difference 

!bt
\[
\mbox{Var}[\bm{\beta}^{\mathrm{OLS}}]-\mbox{Var}(\bm{\beta}^{\mathrm{Ridge}})=\sigma^2 [  \mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{X} + \lambda \mathbf{I} ]^{-1}[ 2\lambda\mathbf{I} + \lambda^2 (\mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{X})^{-1} ] \{ [  \mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{X} + \lambda \mathbf{I} ]^{-1}\}^{T}.
\]
!et
The difference is non-negative definite since each component of the
matrix product is non-negative definite. 
This means the variance we obtain with the standard OLS will always for $\lambda > 0$ be larger than the variance of $\bm{\beta}$ obtained with the Ridge estimator. This has interesting consequences when we discuss the so-called bias-variance trade-off below.
