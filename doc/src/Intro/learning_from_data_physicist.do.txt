=== How will this course be different from a computer science class? ===

Physics and astronomy students have different preparation:
* Strong background and experience with mathematical tools (linear algebra, multivariate calculus) needed for rigorous discussion of statistics.
* Weak / varied background in traditional computer science core topics such as fundamental algorithms, databases, etc.

Physics and astronomy research also has different needs:
  * Our data and models are often fundamentally different from those in typical computer science contexts.
  * We ask different types of questions about our data, sometimes requiring new methods.
  * We have different priorities for judging a ``good'' method: interpretability, error estimates, etc.


=== What is special about machine learning in physics and astronomy? ===

  * We are data _producers_, not (only) data consumers:
    * Experiment / survey design.
    * Optimization of statistical errors.
    * Control of systematic errors.
  
  * Our data represent measurements of physical processes:
    * Measurements often reduce to counting photons, etc, with known a-priori random errors.
    * Dimensions and units are important.
    * Experimental data comes with measurement errors that should be taken into account.

  * Our models are usually traceable to an underlying physical theory:
    * Models constrained by theory and previous observations.
    * Parameter values often intrinsically interesting.
    
  * A parameter error estimate is just as important as its value:
    * Prefer methods that handle input data errors (weights) and provide output parameter error estimates.
  
  * In some experiments and scientific domains, the data sets are *huge* (``Big Data'')
