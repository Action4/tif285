======= A first data and machine learning encounter =======

A first demonstration of machine learning in physics is shown in the accompanying jupyter notebook. We will show some of the strengths of packages like _Scikit-Learn_ in fitting nuclear binding energies to specific models using linear regression.

===== Software and needed installations =====

See the Getting started guide on the course web page.
