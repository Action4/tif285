    "You might recognise this quantity as the *entropy* from statistical mechanics. The interpretation of entropy in statistical mechanics is the measure of uncertainty, which remains about a system after its observable macroscopic properties, such as temperature, pressure and volume, have been taken into account. For a given set of macroscopic variables, the entropy measures the degree to which the probability of the system is spread out over different possible microstates. Specifically, entropy is a logarithmic measure of the number of micro-states with significant probability of being occupied $S = -k_B \\sum_i p_i \\log(p_i)$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n",

However, in this simple example we can immediately realize that the assignment $p_1=0.07$ is the only one that implies no correlation between left-handedness and hair color. Any joint probability smaller than 0.07 implies that left-handed people are less likely to be blonde, and any larger vale indicates that left-handed people are more likely to be blonde.\n",
